  - adding an eventsystem to the interior scene (since it didn't exist already) seemed to get the ui buttons working.
https://answers.unity.com/questions/622459/set-directionallight-rotation-for-daynight-per-tim.html

controls:
p to plant stuff
f to fish
w,s,a,d to move
shift to run while pressing w or s
equip items with 1,2,3,4,5. put away with 6.

stuff with tools (need to equip first)
- water plants w/ c
- shovel with v
- rake with y


TODO:
- add basic cottage interior scene
  - have a fireplace (particle system)
  - table, chairs, kitchenware
  - kitchen
  - books, bookshelf
  - bed
  - desk
  - be able to eat food
  - climb ladder

- get first-person camera/view working better
  - add crosshairs? needs to align with mouse cursor

- get fishing working?

- maybe a basic inventory menu

- flesh out gardening/planting seeds, growing them? watering them?

- add trees, sky, clouds, better looking/expanded terrain to main map

- add another cottage? more buildings. animals?
  - add a tavern!
    - have card game minigame inside

- add fps stuff (target practice?)
 - add some barrels/cans that can get knocked over

- try applying animation to only certain bones for certain situations?
  - e.g. running while armed - I want the player to be able to look around while running with animation
    - take away the torso and above bones from animation keyframes maybe so they don't get affected? 
    - updating rotation manually in lateupdate works but it looks jittery since maybe the animation forces back the old rotation each frame update?

- get walking on terrain working better? or change terrain?
  - one issue is walking on terrain can sometimes push the player in a different direction (b/c rigidbody physics?).
  - maybe don't use physics for walking?
