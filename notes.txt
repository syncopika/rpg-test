TODO:
- add basic cottage interior scene
  - have a fireplace (particle system)
  - table, chairs, kitchenware
  - kitchen
  - books, bookshelf
  - bed
  - desk
- get first-person camera/view working better
  - add crosshairs? needs to align with mouse cursor
- get fishing working?
- get equip object working
- maybe a basic inventory menu
- flesh out gardening/planting seeds, growing them? watering them?
  - watering can -> how to simulate water droplets -> particle system?
- add trees, sky, clouds, better looking/expanded terrain to main map
- add another cottage? more buildings. animals?
- add fps stuff (target practice?)

- try applying animation to only certain bones for certain situations?
  - e.g. running while armed - I want the player to be able to look around while running with animation
    - take away the torso and above bones from animation keyframes maybe so they don't get affected? 
    - updating rotation manually in lateupdate works but it looks jittery since maybe the animation forces back the old rotation each frame update?
