- kinematics for fishing pole floater?
https://vilbeyli.github.io/Projectile-Motion-Tutorial-for-Arrows-and-Missiles-in-Unity3D/ (but since I'm using a rope controller that builds the rope and controls the final position of the fishing pole floater, using kinematics won't help in this case)

- terrain + physics is causing my character to turn in different directions sometimes so was exploring collisions

- allow root motion for jumping?

- c# stuff
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51526/changing-the-value-of-an-element-in-a-list-of-structs (relevant to RopeController)

controls:
p to plant stuff
f to fish
w,s,a,d to move
shift to run while pressing w or s
equip items with 1,2,3,4,5. put away with 6.

stuff with tools (need to equip first)
- water plants w/ c
- shovel with v
- rake with y


TODO:
- add basic cottage interior scene
  - have a fireplace (particle system)
  - table, chairs, kitchenware
  - kitchen
  - books, bookshelf
  - bed
  - desk
  - be able to eat food
  - climb ladder

- finish fishing
  - so far have the basic logic in place - fish sees floater, "bites" floater, got the fishing line changing upon bite
  - next: some randomization for if the fish decides to bite, what to do when a bite occurs (e.g. catching, failing to catch?)

- maybe a basic inventory menu

- flesh out gardening/planting seeds, growing them? watering them?

- add trees, sky, clouds, better looking/expanded terrain to main map

- add another cottage? more buildings. animals?
  - add a tavern!
    - have card game minigame inside

- try applying animation to only certain bones for certain situations?
  - e.g. running while armed - I want the player to be able to look around while running with animation
    - take away the torso and above bones from animation keyframes maybe so they don't get affected? 
    - updating rotation manually in lateupdate works but it looks jittery since maybe the animation forces back the old rotation each frame update?

- get walking on terrain working better? or change terrain?
  - one issue is walking on terrain can sometimes push the player in a different direction (b/c rigidbody physics?).
  - maybe don't use physics for walking?
